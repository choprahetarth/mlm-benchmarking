The name was the most \"unfortunate name Matt Groening could think of for a kid\".[1] Years earlier, in a 1986 Life in Hell comic entitled \"What to Name the Baby\", Groening listed Milhouse as a name \"no longer recommended\".[7] Milhouse is a favorite among the staff as Al Jean noted \"most of the writers are more like Milhouse than Bart\".[1] His last name was given to him by Howard Gewirtz, a freelance writer who wrote the episode \"Homer Defined\". Gewirtz got the name from one of his wife's friends.[8] According to Arden Myrin and Dana Gould (former writer and co-executive producer of The Simpsons), Rob Cohen (Simpsons writer) inspired Milhouse's look.[2]\nThought 3: Milhouse was named after U.S. president Richard Nixon, so the answer is Richard Nixon.\nAction 3: Finish[Richard Nixon]\nQuestion: Guitars for Wounded Warriors is an album that was recorded in the village in which New York county?\nThought 1: I need to search Guitars for Wounded Warriors, then find in which New York county it was recorded.\nAction 1: Search[Guitars for Wounded Warriors]\nObservation 1: Guitars for Wounded Warriors is the sixth solo studio album by guitarist Brian Tarquin, released in August 2014 by Cleopatra Records.

Miso soup is also called omiotsuke (御味御付) in some parts of Japan, especially around Tokyo.. The type of miso paste chosen for the soup defines a great deal of its character and flavor.\nThought 3: Since miso soup commonly contains tofu as small white cubes, the white blocks in the image are tofu.\nAction 3: Finish[tofu]\nQuestion: What type of building might that be?\nThought 1: I should look at the image and see what type of building might be in the context of the image.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: On observing the image I can see that there Is a woman riding a skateboard, another woman on her bike, a few cars in the background and a building in the background. I am not able to see the whole building in the image.\nThought 2: I think I should look at the image again and look at cues on the walls of the building in the background and try to find out what the building might be.\nAction 2: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 2: I see a door, with 'HOURS' and 'OPEN' written there, with images of fruits, vegetables and groceries painted as a wallpaper on the building walls. It is possible that the building is of a grocery store.\nThought 3: Okay, that makes sense, the answer should be a 'grocery store' \nAction 3: Finish[grocery store]\nQuestion: How many more animals need to be added to all of these to get the number ten?\nThought 1: I need to observe the image and count the number of animals already present.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: In the image, there is one adult duck and four ducklings, making a total of five animals.\nThought 2: To get to the number ten, we need five more animals to reach 5+5=10.\nAction 2: Finish[four]\nQuestion: What is the man doing on the bench?\nThought 1: I need to observe the image to see what the man is doing on the bench.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: The man is lying down on the bench with his eyes closed, in a relaxed position, and appears to be resting. Given his posture, it is clear that the man is napping.\nThought 2: The man is likely napping on the bench.\nAction 2: Finish[napping]\nQuestion: In which country is the city mentioned here located?\nThought 1: I need to observe the image to identify any mentions of a city or location.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: The image shows a tennis match, and I see advertising boards in the background with the words 'airberlin.com,' a clue that might refer to Berlin. berlin is the capital of Germany.\nThought 2: The answer of this question is Germany.\nAction 2: Finish[germany]\nQuestion: Where are kites originally from?\nThought 1: Hmm, I need to examine the image to find where the kites are originally from.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: The image shows multiple kites flying in an open area with people around, possibly during a festival or event. Kites are a common feature in many cultures, but I will need to search for their historical origin.\nThought 2: I know that kites are often associated with Asian countries, but I should verify their historical origin with a search.Action 2: Search[origin of kites]\nObservation 2: Could not find origin of kites. Similar: ['Kite', 'Red kite', 'Fighter kite', 'Brent Kite', 'Kite (geometry)'].\nThought 3: Let me search kite instead hoping I could find the origin of the kite there.\nAction 3: Search[kite]\nObservation 3: A kite is a tethered heavier-than-air or lighter-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag forces.[2] A kite consists of wings, tethers and anchors. Kites often have a bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite so the wind can lift it.[3] Some kite designs do not need a bridle; box kites can have a single attachment point. A kite may have fixed or moving anchors that can balance the kite. The name is derived from the kite, the hovering bird of prey.[4]. There are several shapes of kites...\nThought 4: I need to refine the search. Maybe I can look up 'origin'.\nAction 4: Lookup[origin]\nObservation 4: Kites were originally invented in China more than 2,000 years ago, during the Warring States period. They were used for both recreational and military purposes.\nThought 5: With this confirmation from the search, I can conclude that kites are originally from China.\nAction 3: Finish[China]\n",
  "mmmu_train_annotated_art":"Question : <image 1> by Mark Gertler can be found in the Touchstones Rochdale museum. Which artist belonging to the Bloomsbury group was Gertler in a relationship with?\nThought 1 - I don't think I need to look at the image in order to answer this question since I think I can answer that just by looking up Mark's infromation\nAction 1: Search[Mark Gertler]\nObservation 1: Mark Gertler (born Marks Gertler; 9 December 1891 – 23 June 1939) was a British painter of figure subjects, portraits and still-life. His early life and his relationship with Dora Carrington were the inspiration for Gilbert Cannan's novel Mendel.[2] The characters of Loerke in D. H. Lawrence's Women in Love,[3] and Gombauld in Aldous Huxley's Crome Yellow were based on him.[4]\nThought 2: Looks like I might already have found the answer - It seems like Dora Carrington seems a good candidate. However, I am not so sure if she was belonging to the Bloomsbury group when the were in a relationship, let me search her and confirm it.\nAction 2: Search[Dora Carrington]\nObservation 2: Dora de Houghton Carrington (29 March 1893 – 11 March 1932), known generally as Carrington, was an English painter and decorative artist, remembered in part for her association with members of the Bloomsbury Group, especially the writer Lytton Strachey. From her time as an art student, she was known simply by her surname as she considered Dora to be 'vulgar and sentimental'.[1] She was not well known as a painter during her lifetime, as she rarely exhibited and did not sign her work. She worked for a while at the Omega Workshops, and for the Hogarth Press, designing woodcuts.[2]\nThought 3: Let's go! I can confirm that the answer is Dorra Carrington.\nAction: Finish[Dora Carrington]\nQuestion : Which image was generated by AI on <image 1>?\nThought 1: Hmm, I need to look at the two images and identify which one was generated by AI.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: The left image shows a woman in a vibrant pose, likely an illustration, while the right image shows a woman in a purple dress with more realistic features but slight imperfections in facial features like eyebrows and eyes.\nThought 2: I think I should look at both images and try to identify if any of these images is a popular artwork/known image?\nAction 2: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 2:  Historically, the left image's style resembles works from Rolf Armstrong, a 20th-century commercial artist. The AI image, on the right, aims for realism but has some subtle imperfections. Also, it seems to follow traditional illustration techniques and is stylistically consistent, which is not the case in the right image. \nThought 3: The image on the right has characteristics of realism but has some subtle imperfections. It seems like that is the AI generated image.\nAction 3: Finish[The right one.]\nQuestion : <image 1> was coined?\nThought 1: I should look at the image and identify what was it coined.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: The image shows a large group of people in a healthcare setting, with doctors performing surgery and an audience observing from the background.The image closely resembles Thomas Eakins' painting 'The Agnew Clinic,' which depicts a surgical operation led by Dr. Agnew, a renowned surgeon and anatomist.\nThought 2 : Oh I see! Eakins was known for his detailed depictions of medical scenes, and this particular painting was commissioned to honor Dr. Agnew.The answer is that the name of the painting is Agnew Clinic.\nAction 2: Finish[Agnew Clinic]\nQuestion : This William Lamb bronze sculpture of <image 1> is of Angus poet Violet Jacob. Which of her poems was set to music by Jim Reid and performed and recorded by various other musicians, including Battlefield Band, Malinky, and Frightened Rabbit with Lau and Jim Malcolm?\nThought 1: I can look at the image, but actually just let me see if I can find the answer without actually using the image only. Let me search Violet Jacob as I need to find which poem of her was set to music by Jim Reid.\nAction 1: Search[Violet Jacob]\nObservation 1: Violet Jacob (1 September 1863 – 9 September 1946) was a Scottish writer known especially for her historical novel Flemington and for her poetry, mainly in Scots. She was described by a fellow Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid as 'the most considerable of contemporary vernacular poets'.\nThought 2: I think I should refine the search by looking up Jim Reid. Hopefully that works, if not, I will use the ImageObserve function.\nAction 2: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 2:The Wild Geese, a conversation between the author and the North Wind, is a melancholic poem on the theme of homesickness. It was set to music as Norlan' Wind and popularised by Angus singer and songmaker Jim Reid,[8] who also set to music other poems by Jacob and those other Angus poets such as Marion Angus and Helen Cruikshank.[9] Another version, sung by Cilla Fisher and Artie Trezise, appeared on their 1979 Topic Records album Cilla and Artie. Traditional folk band Malinky are among many other artists who have released versions of Norland Wind.[10]\nThought 3: Ah yes! The answer is the Wild Geese.\nAction 3: Finish[Wild Geese]\nQuestion : Who created <image 1>?\nThought 1: I have to look at the image and find out who made it.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1 : It is a very popular image, showing a card game with multiple figures in historical attir and is a work by Lucas van Leyden, a Dutch Renaissance artist known for similar themes.\nThought 2: The answer is Lucas Van Leyden.\nAction 2: Finish[Lucas Van Leyden]\n",

The arrow is pointing to the fovea centralis, which is the central part of the macula.\nThought 2: Hmm, I think I don't have a lot of information on fovea centralis, let me search it up once and see which option out of Absence of bipolar cells., Lack of blood vessels., Absence of ganglion cells., All of the above. works the best in this case.\nAction 2: Search[fovea centralis]\nObservation 2: The fovea centralis is a small, central pit composed of closely packed cones in the eye. It is located in the center of the macula lutea of the retina.[1][2] The fovea is responsible for sharp central vision (also called foveal vision), which is necessary in humans for activities for which visual detail is of primary importance, such as reading and driving. The fovea is surrounded by the parafovea belt and the perifovea outer region.[2]\nThought 3: Ah so basically it consists of cone cells, hence there would be an absence of bipolar and ganglion cells overlaying the photoreceptors. I need to verify if there is a lack of blood vessels as well.\nAction 3: Lookup[blood]\nObservation 3: The fovea is a depression in the inner retinal surface, about 1.5 mm wide, the photoreceptor layer of which is entirely cones and which is specialized for maximum visual acuity. Within the fovea is a region of 0.5mm diameter called the foveal avascular zone (an area without any blood vessels). This allows the light to be sensed without any dispersion or loss. This anatomy is responsible for the depression in the center of the fovea. The foveal pit is surrounded by the foveal rim that contains the neurons displaced from the pit. This is the thickest part of the retina.[5]\nThought 4: Oh so basically all parts make sense, the region has an absence of bipolar cells, it has a lack of blood vessels and also ganglion cells are absent.So all of the above is the correct option.\nAction 4:Finish[All of the Above]\nQuestion : <image 1>Which of the following correctly describes the reception stage of this signal transduction pathway?\nThought 1: Let me have a look at the image and find which of these options is responsible for the reception stage of the signal transduction process.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: This is a diagram showing signal transduction.The reception stage in a signal transduction pathway specifically refers to the initial step where a signaling molecule (in this case, epinephrine) binds to a receptor on the cell surface. \nThought 2: I think we know the answer - epinephrine binds to a g-protein coupled receptor protein present in the cell membrane.\nAction 2: Finish[epinephrine binds to a g-protein coupled receptor protein present in the cell membrane]\nQuestion : What type of change is present in these neurons from the hypoglossal nucleus? <image 1>\nThought 1: Let me observe the image and find what change is present in these neurons from the hypoglossal nucleus.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: The micrograph shops large neurons with loss of central staining of the Nissl substance. This is termed chromatolysis. Acute necrosis would result in neuronal shrinkage as would atrophy. Lipofuscin is a brownish granular pigment in neurons. Ferruginization is deposition of minerals in a dead neuron.\nThought 2: This change is referred to as chromatolysis, which is often a response of neurons to injury, especially when they are trying to regenerate or repair damage.The observation of large neurons with dispersed or lost central Nissl substance is consistent with chromatolysis.\nAction 2: Finish[Chromatolysis]\nQuestion : <image 1>The diagram below shows the movement of material from the inside of a cell to the outside of the cell through a protein channel. What type of cellular transport is occurring?\nThought 1 : I must look at the image and find out which cellular transport is happening?\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: Oh this is a typical diagram of molecules moving in a cell from the inside (having higher concentration) towards outside (having lower concentration).\nThought 2: This process is a passive transport since it is driven using passive transport and molecules are moving towards equilibrium. That is the answer\nAction 2: Finish[Passive transport because molecules are moving toward equilibrium]\n",

There are horizontal lines in the tree connecting these branches.\nThought 2:  In phylogenetic trees, horizontal lines often represent the relative length of time in existence of different species or lineages, showing how long each lineage has been evolving independently.\nAction 2: Finish[relative length of time in existence]\nQuestion : In <image 1>, if the nuclei were contained within the stalks of Acetabularia, what types of caps would you expect from graft A?\nThought 1: I think I need to look at the image and get information from it critical to providing the answer for the expected cap type from graft A if the nuclei are contained within the stalks of Acetabularia. \nAction 1: ImageObserve[image] \nObservation 1 : The image shows two species of Acetabularia (A. mediterranea and A. crenulata) with distinct cap shapes. Graft A has a stalk from one species attached to the base of another species.\nThought 2: Graft A contains an A. mediterranea foot, and since the foot houses the nucleus, it would regenerate an A. mediterranea cap. I am confident this is the answer.\nAction 2: Finish[A. mediterranea]\nQuestion : <image 1> What kind of sugar is this, aldose or ketose?\nThought 1: I need to look at the image to identify if it is an aldose or ketose.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: The structure shows a carbon chain with hydroxyl (OH) groups attached to most carbons, and there’s a carbonyl (C=O) group at the end of the chain.The structure contains 6 carbons, 12 hydrogens, and 6 oxygens, giving it the formula C6H12O6.\nThought 2: The figure shows a picture of glucose, which is a aldose.\nAction 2: Finish[aldose]\nQuestion : For your independent research, you transferred lymphocyte populations between syngeneic mice. You irradiated recipients first to ablate (get rid of) existing lymphocytes, then transferred defined cell populations from donors of same genetic background. The result is shown in <image 1>. What does this experiment tell us?\nThought 1: I must look at the image and try to reason what is this ablation experiment trying to tell us.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: The image outlines an experiment where irradiated mice (to remove lymphocytes) were reconstituted with various cell populations: nothing, bone marrow cells alone, thymus cells alone, and both bone marrow and thymus cells. The ability to mount an antibody response to a T-dependent antigen was then measured.Observing the results, I see that only the group receiving both bone marrow and thymus cells showed a successful antibody response (++), while groups with either bone marrow cells or thymus cells alone showed no antibody response (--).\nThought 2: Oh, I see! Given the options I can say that the image is definitely trying to say that both bone marrow and thymus cells are required for a response.\nAction 2: Finish[Both B cells and T cells are required for an antibody response.]\nQuestion : In the Section of male pelvis, identify the 92 structure. <image 1>\nThought 1: Given that I have a cross section image of the male pelvis, let me try to identify what is the number 92 labelling.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: I see that 92 is represented by a muscle near the back of the hip-joint. On closer inspection it seems like it is siuated partly within the  lesser pelvis.\nThought 2:Based on typical pelvic anatomy, the Obturator internus muscle is located on the lateral walls of the pelvis. But I am not sure, let me search it once and confirm.\nAction 2: Search[Obturator internus]\nObservation 2: The internal obturator muscle or obturator internus muscle originates on the medial surface of the obturator membrane, the ischium near the membrane, and the rim of the pubis. It exits the pelvic cavity through the lesser sciatic foramen. The internal obturator is situated partly within the lesser pelvis, and partly at the back of the hip-joint. It functions to help laterally rotate femur with hip extension and abduct femur with hip flexion, as well as to steady the femoral head in the acetabulum.\nThought 3: It matches the description perfectly, my guess was righ. The answer is Obturator internus.\nAction 3: Finish[Obturator internus]\n",
  "mmmu_train_annotated_agriculture": "Question : <image 1> This isn't related to plant diseases, but it's crucial for the production of potatoes. Can you tell me if either of these two insects, or maybe even both, are harmful to potatoes?\nThought 1: There are two insects in the image. They may or may not be harmful to potatoes. Let me first observe which insects are in the given image.\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: The image shows two beetles with distinctive black and white or yellow striping patterns on their backs. The beetle on the left has more prominent yellow-orange coloration with black markings and black antennae. It appears to be Colorado potato beetle. The beetle on the right has cream or pale yellow elytra (wing covers) and tan antennae. It is a sunflower beetle.\nThought 2: The left beetle with black-colored antennae is the Colorado Potato Beetle and is harmful to potatoes. It is one of the options. \nAction2: Finish[The one with black colored antennae]\nQuestion : <image 1> What is the count of pathogens infecting this sunflower leaf?\nObservation 1: There may or may not be some pathogen(s) in the image. Let me first observe the image. \nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 2: The image uploaded shows signs of fungal or bacterial infection. There is some white powdery substance, small brown spots which can be rust, septoria.\nThought 2: I think there are 3 pathogens affecting this leaf.

This is a form of gummosis on the trunk and branches. I need to find the reason behind the massive gum production in grapefruits trees in Cyprus. Let me search.\nAction 1: Search[Gummosis]\nObservation 1: Gummosis is the formation of patches of a gummy substance on the surface of certain plants, particularly fruit trees. This occurs when sap oozes from wounds or cankers as a reaction to outside stimuli such as adverse weather conditions, infections, insect problems, or mechanical damage. It is understood as a plant physiological disease.\nThought 2: The main cause of gummosis appears to be physiological stress. It is one of the options.\nAction 2: Finish[Physiological stress]\nQuestion : <image 1> Which among the following assertions holds true?\nThought 1: Given are 4 assertions and an image. Let me first observe the image. \nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: The image appears to show a group of aphids, small sap-sucking insects that commonly infest plants. Aphids can be harmful to plants as they feed on plant sap, weakening the plant and potentially spreading viral diseases.\nThought 2: I can assess each assertion one by one and pick the best. The first assertion: “Laboratory work with micro manipulators can mimic the transmission of viruses.” This is largely accurate. In laboratory settings, micro-manipulators can be used to simulate conditions of virus transmission. The second assertion: “All plant-feeding insects can transmit viruses”. This is incorrect. Not all plant-feeding insects transmit viruses. The third assertion: “All plant viruses can be transmitted by insects.” This is incorrect. While many plant viruses are indeed transmitted by insects, not all plant viruses rely on insect vectors. The fourth assertion is: “Most viruses have a specific relationship with their vectors.” This is correct. Virus-vector specificity is a well-documented phenomenon in plant virology. Many plant viruses are transmitted by a specific type of insect, and the virus requires a particular interaction with the vector. Thus fourth is the correct answer. \nAction 2: Finish[Most viruses have a specific relationship with their vectors]\nQuestion : <image 1> What among the listed issues would not be the cause for the petioles of this rhubarb splitting?\nThought 1: Let me look at the image and try to find from the options -Physiological problems, Phytoplasma infection, Bacteria, Animal damage, that among these listed issues what could not be the cause of the splitting of petioles in this rhubarb?\nAction 1: ImageObserve[image]\nObservation 1: The image shows rhubarb petioles that are split but appear healthy. The tissue is not discolored, rotten, or water-soaked, indicating that there might not be an infection causing this issue.\nThought 2: Let me analyze all the options Bacteria - Bacteria can cause leaves to collapse due to rotting, but the tissue in this image does not appear to be rotten or water soaked. It appears to be healthy apart from the areas that have split open. ; Physiological problem - This is what I think is causing the problem (although it is very strange as the plants either side are unaffected). Plants, usually fruits, can split open if they take up water too quickly. It may superficially look like insect damage or pathogen infection, but the wound is generally clean ; Phytoplasma infection - Phytoplasma infection can cause gross morphological changes to the development of a plant. There is no evidence that this symptom is due to a phytoplasma but this is the kind of symptom they can provoke ; Animal damage - It looks like a large animal has laid on the plant and snapped the leaf blade at the point of attachment to the petiole. There is no sign of any infection at the site of breakage. I think on analysis of all these options - The answer is Bacteria.\nAction 2: Finish[Bacteria]\n"
