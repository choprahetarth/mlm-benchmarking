Question : <image 1> by Mark Gertler can be found in the Touchstones Rochdale museum. Which artist belonging to the Bloomsbury group was Gertler in a relationship with?\n
Thought 1 - I don't think I need to look at the image in order to answer this question since I think I can answer that just by looking up Mark's infromation\n
Action 1: Search[Mark Gertler]\n
Observation 1: Mark Gertler (born Marks Gertler; 9 December 1891 – 23 June 1939) was a British painter of figure subjects, portraits and still-life. His early life and his relationship with Dora Carrington were the inspiration for Gilbert Cannan's novel Mendel.[2] The characters of Loerke in D. H. Lawrence's Women in Love,[3] and Gombauld in Aldous Huxley's Crome Yellow were based on him.[4]\n
Thought 2: Looks like I might already have found the answer - It seems like Dora Carrington seems a good candidate. However, I am not so sure if she was belonging to the Bloomsbury group when the were in a relationship, let me search her and confirm it.\n
Action 2: Search[Dora Carrington]\n
Observation 2: Dora de Houghton Carrington (29 March 1893 – 11 March 1932), known generally as Carrington, was an English painter and decorative artist, remembered in part for her association with members of the Bloomsbury Group, especially the writer Lytton Strachey. From her time as an art student, she was known simply by her surname as she considered Dora to be "vulgar and sentimental".[1] She was not well known as a painter during her lifetime, as she rarely exhibited and did not sign her work. She worked for a while at the Omega Workshops, and for the Hogarth Press, designing woodcuts.[2]\n
Thought 3: Let's go! I can confirm that the answer is Dorra Carrington.\n
Action: Finish[Dora Carrington]\n
Question : Which image was generated by AI on <image 1>?\n
Thought 1: Hmm, I need to look at the two images and identify which one was generated by AI.\n
Action 1: ImageObserve[image]\n
Observation 1: The left image shows a woman in a vibrant pose, likely an illustration, while the right image shows a woman in a purple dress with more realistic features but slight imperfections in facial features like eyebrows and eyes.\n
Thought 2: I think I should look at both images and try to identify if any of these images is a popular artwork/known image?\n
Action 2: ImageObserve[image]\n
Observation 2:  Historically, the left image's style resembles works from Rolf Armstrong, a 20th-century commercial artist. The AI image, on the right, aims for realism but has some subtle imperfections. Also, it seems to follow traditional illustration techniques and is stylistically consistent, which is not the case in the right image. \n
Thought 3: The image on the right has characteristics of realism but has some subtle imperfections. It seems like that is the AI generated image.\n
Action 3: Finish[The right one.]\n
Question : <image 1> was coined?\n

Observation 1: The image shows a large group of people in a healthcare setting, with doctors performing surgery and an audience observing from the background.The image closely resembles Thomas Eakins' painting "The Agnew Clinic," which depicts a surgical operation led by Dr. Agnew, a renowned surgeon and anatomist.\n

Action 2: Finish[Agnew Clinic]\n
Question : This William Lamb bronze sculpture of <image 1> is of Angus poet Violet Jacob. Which of her poems was set to music by Jim Reid and performed and recorded by various other musicians, including Battlefield Band, Malinky, and Frightened Rabbit with Lau and Jim Malcolm?\n
Thought 1: I can look at the image, but actually just let me see if I can find the answer without actually using the image only. Let me search Violet Jacob as I need to find which poem of her was set to music by Jim Reid.\n
Action 1: Search[Violet Jacob]\n
Observation 1: Violet Jacob (1 September 1863 – 9 September 1946) was a Scottish writer known especially for her historical novel Flemington and for her poetry, mainly in Scots. She was described by a fellow Scottish poet Hugh MacDiarmid as "the most considerable of contemporary vernacular poets".\n
Thought 2: I think I should refine the search by looking up Jim Reid. Hopefully that works, if not, I will use the ImageObserve function.\n
Action 2: ImageObserve[image]\n
Observation 2:The Wild Geese, a conversation between the author and the North Wind, is a melancholic poem on the theme of homesickness.
