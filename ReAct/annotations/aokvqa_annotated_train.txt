Action 2: ImageObserve[image]\n
Observation 2: I see one Cadbury Dairy milk triple decker chocolate, one receipt of Coles, one holy bible, a book titled neverwhere. The label on another receipt and bag are non-readable due to the quality of the image.\n
Thought 3: Cadbury, Bible and the Book can be found anywhere in the world, however Coles is a supermarket chain and we can probably find out its origin and get to know which place these things (including the licorice pack) might be purchased from. \n
Action 3: Search[Coles]\n

Originally marketed as a temperance drink and intended as a patent medicine, Coca-Cola was invented in the late 19th century by John Stith Pemberton in Atlanta, Georgia. In 1888, Pemberton sold the ownership rights to Asa Griggs Candler, a businessman, whose marketing tactics led Coca-Cola to its dominance of the global soft-drink market throughout the 20th and 21st century.[4] The name refers to two of its original ingredients: coca leaves and kola nuts (a source of caffeine).[5] The current formula of Coca-Cola remains a trade secret; however, a variety of reported recipes and experimental recreations have been published. \n

Observation 2: Ovis guineensis Linnaeus, 1758. Ovis strepsiceros Linnaeus, 1758. Sheep (pl.: sheep) or domestic sheep  (Ovis aries) are a domesticated, ruminant mammal typically kept as livestock. Although the term sheep can apply to other species in the genus Ovis, in everyday usage it almost always refers to domesticated sheep. Like all ruminants, sheep are members of the order Artiodactyla, the even-toed ungulates.\n
Thought 3: I think I should refine the query and lookup the keyword 'diet'.\n
Action 3: Lookup[Diet]\n
Observation 3: Sheep are herbivorous. Most breeds prefer to graze on grass and other short roughage, avoiding the taller woody parts of plants that goats readily consume.[48] Both sheep and goats use their lips and tongues to select parts of the plant that are easier to digest or higher in nutrition.[48] Sheep, however, graze well in monoculture pastures where most goats fare poorly.[48]\n
Thought 4: Ah! I see. I have confirmed that sheep are herbivorous and that is the answer.\n

Action 2: Search[Miso Soup]\n
Observation 2: Miso soup (味噌汁 or お味噌汁, miso-shiru or omiso-shiru, お-/o- being honorific) is a traditional Japanese soup consisting of miso paste mixed with a dashi stock.

Miso soup is also called omiotsuke (御味御付) in some parts of Japan, especially around Tokyo.. The type of miso paste chosen for the soup defines a great deal of its character and flavor.\n
Thought 3: Since miso soup commonly contains tofu as small white cubes, the white blocks in the image are tofu.\n

Observation 3: A kite is a tethered heavier-than-air or lighter-than-air craft with wing surfaces that react against the air to create lift and drag forces.[2] A kite consists of wings, tethers and anchors. Kites often have a bridle and tail to guide the face of the kite so the wind can lift it.[3] Some kite designs do not need a bridle; box kites can have a single attachment point. A kite may have fixed or moving anchors that can balance the kite. The name is derived from the kite, the hovering bird of prey.[4]. There are several shapes of kites...\n
Thought 4: I need to refine the search. Maybe I can look up 'origin'.\n
Action 4: Lookup[origin]\n
Observation 4: Kites were originally invented in China more than 2,000 years ago, during the Warring States period. They were used for both recreational and military purposes.\n
Thought 5: With this confirmation from the search, I can conclude that kites are originally from China.\n
